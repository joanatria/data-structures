1. Stacks (MP 1): Implementing the `convertToPostfix()` method within the `InfixToPostfix` class, converting a valid infix expression to postfix notation.

2. Binary Search Tree (MP 2): Completing the `inorder()`, `postorder()`, and `levelOrder()` traversal methods in the `BinarySearchTree` class.

3. AVL Tree (MP 3): Creating an `AVLTree` class to perform AVL insertion and deletion, along with preorder, inorder, and postorder traversals.

4. Cinema Program: Developing a program to manage traffic flow in a cinema based on a provided JSON layout, ensuring customers exit efficiently without congestion.

5. Firefighting Program (labexam2): Designing a program to find the shortest path between two locations on a map represented as a grid with roads marked by `*` and
   intersections marked by letters. Implementing Floyd's Algorithm to compute the shortest path and minimum distance.

Each task requires different algorithms and data structures (stacks, trees, graphs), showcasing proficiency in various aspects of data structures and algorithms. 
All projects above were implemented using Java.
